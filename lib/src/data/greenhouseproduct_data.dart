        "This strain will quickly elevate your mood with a strongly psychoactive cerebral buzz. It provides a social energy that can help reduce the effects of anxiety and depression. Despite its mental stimulation, it can leave you locked to your couch for many hours, so be aware of the quantity consumed. In large quantities, this strain is a strong pain reliever, making it a great multi-functional strain. Best used during the day or early evening.",
